arithmetic progression: diff b/w no, is const(k)
a: fist term      d: const difference   n: nth term   L: last term
n = a + (n-1)d
Sum till n  = n(a+L)/2

Geometric progression: ratio b/w consecutive numbers is constant
r: common ratio   
n = ak^(n-1)
sum till n = a(1- r^n) / 1-r


Sum Theory: Σ (Sum Symbol) used for adding up numbers
Σ, n , x=1
